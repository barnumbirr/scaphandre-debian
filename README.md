# scaphandre-debian

This repository contains the source to build a Debian package for [scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre).

## Usage

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed locally, just run the following:

```bash
user@hostname$ ./build.sh
```
By default this will build scaphandre v0.1.1 on Debian Buster.

If you want to customize the build at runtime, use the following:

```bash
user@hostname$ ./build.sh -i debian:unstable-slim -v 0.1.0
```
Don't forget to update `debian/changelog` so your package is generated with the correct version.

## Release

To publish a new package version to Github, follow these steps:
  * update the `VERSION` variable in `build.sh`
  * add a new entry in `debian/changelog`
  * create a new tag with the Debian package version
